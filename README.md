Start Hapiness
===

## Goal
The main idea for this project is help you to start a new Hapi + MongoDB project. In this case is a simplest boilerplate project using this tools + Promises =D

## Batteries
- **Hapi** - Web framework
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL Database
- **Bluebird** - Promises and more
- **Lab** - BDD and Code Coverage framework
- **Chai** - Assertion library

## TODO
- [ ] Add Auth + jwt
- [ ] Add support for others databases
- [ ] Add support for loggers
- [ ] Add support for packaging and deploy
- [x] Add Azkfile.js

## Run this Project
To run this project you need have installed 
- **Node.js** (latest version)
- **MongoDB** 3.0.6

And then just run:
```sh
npm run build && npm start
```

If you want to run tests just run:
```sh
npm test
```

To reply this project for your own new project:
```
npm run duplicate NAME
```
NOTE: All models, routes, validators, controllers, tests and LICENCE will be removed. Only the bootstrap files will be stay. Git project too.

## Run this Project Azk version
Running this project using [azk][0]. Azk will just run this project in a Docker container, by this no one depencies are required, because all dependencies will be installed in the container.

azk start 
```

If you want to run tests just run:
